## Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

### About Me
Hey there! 
I'm Shakeel Khan, a Student of Bachelor’s in Computer Science with a passion for Programming. I enjoy diving into complex problems and crafting elegant solutions using ‘C++, OOP, DSA, HTML, CSS’ on Visual Studio code.

### My Projects
This repository is a collection of my coding projects that showcase my skills and creativity. Here's a glimpse of what you'll find here:

- Ludo Game Project:
The Ludo Game project is a classic board game developed using C++ programming language and graphics libraries. It offers a digital version of the popular Ludo game, allowing players to enjoy the game on their computer screens.
This project creates an interactive and visually appealing gaming experience. It includes features such as a colorful game board, player tokens, dice rolling, and player movement
- Pharmacy Management: [
The Pharmacy Management System project is designed to efficiently manage the operations of a pharmacy using Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts. It provides a digital solution for handling various tasks related to inventory management, prescription tracking, and customer management in a pharmacy setting.
The project leverages DSA to optimize data storage and retrieval, ensure efficient searching and sorting of pharmacy records, and facilitate smooth and accurate workflow. It aims to streamline the management of medicines, prescriptions, and customer information while ensuring data integrity and security.

Each project is organized in its own folder/repository, containing the necessary code, documentation, and any additional resources. Feel free to explore them to get a better understanding of my work.
